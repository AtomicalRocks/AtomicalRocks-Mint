# AtomicalRocks-Mint

### How to mint?
This tutorial is for those who already have the Atomicals environment installed. If you haven't installed it yet, we recommend checking https://github.com/atomicals/atomicals-js.

### Step 1
We have a total supply of 100 Atomicals Rocks.
To mint, you need to download the .json file of the item you want to mint.
You can find all 100 .json files here: https://github.com/AtomicalRocks/AtomicalRocks-Mint/tree/main/Rocks.
