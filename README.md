# AtomicalRocks-Mint

### How to mint?
This tutorial is for those who already have the Atomicals environment installed. If you haven't installed it yet, we recommend checking https://github.com/atomicals/atomicals-js.

### Step 1
We have a total supply of 100 Atomicals Rocks.
To mint, you need to download the .json file of the item you want to mint.
You can find all 100 .json files here: https://github.com/AtomicalRocks/AtomicalRocks-Mint/tree/main/Rocks.

 Before attempting to mint any AtomicalRocks, you have to check if the item you want to mint is available.
 Query the status of a single item:
Replace "item-name" with the number of the .json file you want to download.
```
yarn cli get-container-item "#atomicalrocks" "item-name"
```

### Step 2
In your command line, run the following command:
```
yarn cli mint-item "#atomicalrocks" "item-name" "path/to/item-name.json" --satsbyte=60
```
Replace "item-name" with the number of the .json file you downloaded earlier.

Example:
```
yarn cli mint-item "#atomicalrocks" "2" "C:\Users\AtomicalRocks\Desktop\item-2.json" --satsbyte=60
```

### Done
Once your transaction is confirmed in the mempool, you will receive your AtomicalRock at your primary address.
